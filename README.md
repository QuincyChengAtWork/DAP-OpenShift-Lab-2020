# DAP OpenShift Lab 2020
This is a tutorial on how to secure secrets of OpenShift applications by CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP).   
We will cover deploying DAP follower instances manually, and by follower seed fetcher.
Secretless Broker & inital container will also be covered in this tutorial.

Extra tech challenges will be included in each sections for quick learners.

## Overview

[OKD](https://www.okd.io) is used as the OpenShift platform to host the [demo app](https://github.com/jeepapichet/cityapp)
The application will connect to a MySQL database to retreive data, and during authenication, [secrets](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Get%20Started/key_concepts/secrets.html) will be used by the application.

[Dynamic Access Provider (DAP)](https://docs.cyberark.com/Product-Doc/OnlineHelp/AAM-DAP/Latest/en/Content/Get%20Started/WhatIsConjur.html) is used in this tutorial to secure & manage the secrets.
