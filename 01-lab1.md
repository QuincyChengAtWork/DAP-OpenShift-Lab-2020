# Lab 1: OpenShift Fundamental - App with embedded secret

In this lab, we are going to get familar with OpenShift by deploying a sample application.

We will deploy our test application 'cityapp'. 
The application connect to mysql database and display random city name. 
The application will use hardcoded credential in the deployment configuration.

## Login to OKD

2.	oc login https://okd.cyberark.local:8443 -u admin
3.	oc whoami


## Create projects

5.	oc new-project cityapp
6.	oc project


## Push image
7.	Push cityapp image from local Docker to OpenShift integrated registry. This image is already pre-built and load to local registry on docker03 as cityapp:1.0. 

To login to OpenShift integrated registry, we can use token from oc whoami -t
8.	oc whoami -t
docker login -u _ -p [Enter token from previous step] docker-registry-default.apps.okd.cyberarkdemo.com
To do this in single command
docker login -u _ -p $(oc whoami -t) docker-registry-default.apps.okd.cyberarkdemo.com
Tag and push cityapp container image to Openshift registry
docker tag cityapp:1.0 docker-registry-default.apps.okd.cyberarkdemo.com/cityapp/cityapp
docker push  docker-registry-default.apps.okd.cyberarkdemo.com/cityapp/cityapp


## Deploy app


Review cityapp-hardcode.yaml deployment config template and make necessary change. Then apply this file to Openshift
oc apply -f cityapp-hardcode.yml

Take note that docker registry in deployment config file is referencing internal svc url. This internal registry usually does not require DockerPullSecret to fetch image from within cluster.
Openshift integrated registry external URL: docker-registry-default.apps.okd.cyberarkdemo.com
Openshift integrated registry internal URL (service name inside cluster: docker-registry.default.svc:5000 OR docker-registry.default.svc.cluster.local:5000

10.	Check Pods and test that the application is working
11.	oc get pods
12.	oc exec -it [pod-name] curl http://localhost:3000


## Create secret & route


13.	Now we will modify this deployment to store DBPassword using OpenShift Secret
Create an openshift OpenShift to store mysql01 password. Replace XXXXX with password that CPM changed in prelab
oc create secret generic mysql01-secret --from-literal=password=XXXXXXXXX
14.	On OpenShift UI, go to application deployment and update DBPassword to access secret that we just created
 
15.	Click deploy to redeploy and confirm that application still function
16.	Create route for this application in OpenShift UI to expose this application to outside cluster
From openshift UI -> cityapp -> service -> click create route
Leave all the default setting and click create. 
17.	Test access from chrome browser on CLIENT VM to the route created in previous step
